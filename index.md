I am currently a research assitant at the School of Economics, University of Adelaide. I have been tutoring data analytics, econometrics and mathematical economics. I also held a postion as a visiting lecturer at the same school. Before that, I used to work as an economics research fellow at an independent research think-tank called [Cambodia Developpment Resource Institue](https://www.cdri.com.kh/). My research interests are in the fields of economic development, applied econometrics and health economics.
